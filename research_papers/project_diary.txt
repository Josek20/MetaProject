- Trying to implement caching the subtrees
  1) when creating ProductNode structure for an expression,
    computing the embeddings of a substructeres 
- Problems
  - previous embeddings != to the caching embeddings

- Disqused the ways to improve performance
  1) caching the subtrees embeddings of the expression
  2) Switch to A from greedy best first search
  3) greedy epsilon takes a lot of time get read of delete!
- Problems that occure
  - heuristic may learn suboptimal solution does not search for a better one
  - tree may expand in depth rather than in breadth

- Disqused the ways to improve performance
  1) caching the subtrees embeddings of the expression
  2) expand multiple nodes at once
- Problems that occure
  - There is an issue with loss sometimes it becames infinit
  - Hard to know whether the epxression cant find solution or there is not enough rules provide
